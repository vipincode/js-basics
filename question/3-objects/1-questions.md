4. **Property Descriptors:**
   - What are property descriptors and how do you define them?

## Intermediate Level

5. **Iteration:**

   - How do you iterate over the properties of an object?

6. **Object.assign():**

   - What does `Object.assign()` do and how do you use it?

7. **Object Spread:**

   - How do you use the spread operator with objects?

8. **Cloning Objects:**
