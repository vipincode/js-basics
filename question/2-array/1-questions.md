   - How do you use `reduce()` to flatten a nested array?

10. **Performance:**

- What are the time complexities of common array operations (e.g., push, pop, shift, unshift, access)?

11. **Searching and Sorting:**

- How would you implement a binary search on a sorted array?
- How would you sort an array of objects by a specific property?

12. **Array Buffers:**

## Coding Problems

13. **Reverse an Array:**

    - Write a function to reverse an array without using the built-in `reverse()` method.

14. **Rotate an Array:**

    - Write a function to rotate an array by `k` positions to the right.

15. **Subarray Sum:**

    - Write a function to find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum (Kadane's Algorithm).

16. **Intersection of Two Arrays:**

    - Write a function to find the intersection of two arrays.

17. **Missing Number:**

    - Given an array of `n` numbers taken from the range `0` to `n`, find the one that is missing.

18. **Product of Array Except Self:**

    - Write a function that returns an array where each element is the product of all other elements in the array, without using division.

19. **Spiral Order Matrix:**

    - Write a function to return the elements of a 2D array in spiral order.

20. **Longest Consecutive Sequence:**
    - Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
